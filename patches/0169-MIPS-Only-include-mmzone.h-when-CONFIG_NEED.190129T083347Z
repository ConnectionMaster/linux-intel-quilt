Subject: [PATCH 169/580] MIPS: Only include mmzone.h when
 CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=y

commit 66a4059ba72c23ae74a7c702894ff76c4b7eac1f upstream.

MIPS' asm/mmzone.h includes the machine/platform mmzone.h
unconditionally, but since commit bb53fdf395ee ("MIPS: c-r4k: Add
r4k_blast_scache_node for Loongson-3") is included by asm/rk4cache.h for
all r4k-style configs regardless of CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES.

This is problematic when CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=n because both the
loongson3 & ip27 mmzone.h headers unconditionally define the NODE_DATA
preprocessor macro which is aready defined by linux/mmzone.h, resulting
in the following build error:

  In file included from ./arch/mips/include/asm/mmzone.h:10,
                   from ./arch/mips/include/asm/r4kcache.h:23,
                   from arch/mips/mm/c-r4k.c:33:
  ./arch/mips/include/asm/mach-loongson64/mmzone.h:48: error: "NODE_DATA" redefined [-Werror]
   #define NODE_DATA(n)  (&__node_data[(n)]->pglist)

                   from ./include/linux/irq.h:19,

                   from ./arch/mips/include/asm/hardirq.h:16,
                   from ./include/linux/hardirq.h:9,
                   from arch/mips/mm/c-r4k.c:11:
  ./include/linux/mmzone.h:907: note: this is the location of the previous definition
   #define NODE_DATA(nid)  (&contig_page_data)

Resolve this by only including the machine mmzone.h when
CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES=y, which also removes the need for the empty
mach-generic version of the header which we delete.
