Subject: [PATCH 162/580] KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v2: Set active_source to 0 when
 restoring state

commit 60c3ab30d8c2ff3a52606df03f05af2aae07dc6b upstream.

When restoring the active state from userspace, we don't know which CPU
was the source for the active state, and this is not architecturally
exposed in any of the register state.

Set the active_source to 0 in this case.  In the future, we can expand
on this and exposse the information as additional information to
userspace for GICv2 if anyone cares.
